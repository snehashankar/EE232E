This README contains the requirements and steps that are required to execute Project 4.

#########################################
		Dependencies 
#########################################
R libraries: 
repr
igraph
data.table

Python libraries:
numpy
defaultdict

#########################################
		Usage 
#########################################
This project was done in both python and R. Data preprocessing and clean-up was done in python. Whereas everything else was done in R.

Each section of the project is done in a separate iPython notebook. The iPython files belonging to this project are as follows: <<name>>.ipyb files :
1) Q1-Py	
2) Q2to5-R
3) HelperQ6_Edgelist
4) Q6-7
5) Q8abc
6) Q9
7) Q10-11
8) Q12_13

The question numbers have been written as a comment in each cell of the respective ipynb files.

Constraints:
For creation of communities, FastGreedy Algorithm from igraph was used. this algorith requires a lot of memory.
For successful run, one of the following can be used:
1. A laptop with more than 16 GB RAM. (32 GB Preferred).
2. Amazon EC2 Cloud 
3. Google Cloud

Please feel free to contact the team members in case of any queries in execution of the project.
